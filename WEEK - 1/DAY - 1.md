## üìÇ Week 1 - RTL Design and Synthesis
# SKY130 PDK & RTL Design ‚Äî Day 1 Learnings üöÄ

Welcome to my Day 1 journey into digital IC design using the SKY130 PDK! Today, I focused on understanding the basics of simulation, Verilog coding, and the first steps of synthesis using open-source tools. This repo captures my notes, example codes, and workflows.

## What I Learned Today üîç

### Simulator, Design, and Testbench Basics  
- **Simulator:** A software tool that verifies the correctness of your digital design by applying test inputs and checking outputs. It‚Äôs like a virtual lab where you catch bugs before hardware fabrication.  
- **Design:** Your actual Verilog code that describes the intended hardware behavior.  
- **Testbench:** A specialized Verilog environment that generates stimuli (inputs) to your design and monitors outputs during simulation to confirm the design works as expected.

### Getting Started with `iverilog` for Simulation  
- Learned the simulation flow using **iverilog**, an open-source Verilog compiler and simulator.  
- Compiled both the design and testbench files to generate a `.vcd` (Value Change Dump) file.  
- Opened the `.vcd` file in **GTKWave** to visually inspect signal transitions over time ‚Äî super helpful for debugging!

### Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer üß©  
- Practiced by simulating a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer**.  
- The mux chooses between two inputs (`i0` and `i1`) based on a select signal (`sel`), passing the chosen input to the output (`y`).  
- Ran the simulation, viewed waveforms, and confirmed the mux behaves correctly.

### Verilog Code Snippet: 2-to-1 Multiplexer

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @ (*)
    begin
        if(sel)
            y <= i1;
        else 
            y <= i0;
    end
endmodule
```
**How it works:**  When sel is 1, y follows i1; when sel is 0, y follows i0.

This basic example solidifies understanding of combinational logic and sensitivity lists.

## Introduction to Yosys ‚Äî The Synthesis Powerhouse ‚öôÔ∏è
- Yosys is an open-source synthesis tool that transforms your Verilog RTL into gate-level netlists.
- It performs optimizations, technology mapping, and generates netlists tailored to specific process libraries like SKY130.
- Learned why gate libraries (.lib files) contain different ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of cells optimized for speed, power, or area trade-offs.

## Hands-On: Synthesizing the Mux Design
- Synthesized the 2-to-1 mux with Yosys using the SKY130 liberty library.
- Explored the technology mapping step where the RTL is matched to real hardware gates.
- Visualized the gate-level schematic generated by Yosys to see how the design breaks down into fundamental logic gates.

# Commands I Used üíª
```
# Clone the example repository with design and testbench
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files

# Install required tools
sudo apt install iverilog gtkwave

# Compile and simulate the mux
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
./a.out

# View the waveform
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd

# Launch Yosys for synthesis
yosys

# Inside Yosys, run the following commands:
read_liberty -lib /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog good_mux.v
synth -top good_mux
abc -liberty /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```
## Summary ‚ú®

Day 1 was a fantastic start! I learned how simulators, designs, and testbenches interact to verify digital circuits. Running my first simulation with iverilog and GTKWave gave me confidence in verifying RTL code. Diving into Yosys synthesis introduced me to the powerful transformation of RTL into gate-level netlists tailored for SKY130 technology.
