# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program
This repository is a week-by-week log of my progress and learnings in the VSD SoC Tapeout Program.  In this program, we explore the complete flow of System-on-Chip (SoC) design â€” starting from RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and verification to GDSII (final layout) using open-source EDA tools.
