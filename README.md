# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program
This repository is a week-by-week log of my progress and learnings in the VSD SoC Tapeout Program.  In this program, we explore the complete flow of System-on-Chip (SoC) design — starting from RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and verification to GDSII (final layout) using open-source EDA tools.

## Why this program matters:

- Strengthens India’s semiconductor design ecosystem.
- Empowers students and engineers with open-source silicon design skills.
- Contributes to the global RISC-V and open hardware movement.

### This repository will serve as:

- A structured learning journal documenting tasks and solutions.
- A reference for open-source SoC design workflows.
- A contribution to the growing open-source VLSI community.

 ## Flow of the VLSI

 RTL Design → Simulation → FPGA Prototype (Optional) → Synthesis → Timing Analysis → Floorplanning → Placement → Routing → Verification → Tapeout → Fabrication
